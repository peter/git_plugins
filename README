GitPlugins
==========

This is a simple plugin to keep track of Rails plugins that are kept in Git repositories.
The idea is to provide at least some of the functionality of svn externals.

I keep my Rails application in Git and I develop open source Rails plugins that each live in their
own repositories. This plugin provides a way to keep track of those plugins and:

1) Bootstrap your Rails app by cloning all the Git plugins needed under vendor/plugins.
2) Add all git plugins to .gitignore.
3) Be able a git status or git pull on all Git plugins.

As an alternative to using this plugin or some other approach to nested Git repositories you
might want to check out Git submodules and the git-rake rake tasks for managing them:

Please note that Git submodules don't work like svn externals though and as it says in the git-rake README:

"git submodules are inherently not well-suited for frequently updated projects"

Example
=======

Add the file config/initializers/git_plugins.rb:

GitPlugins.configure do |g|
  g.plugin :name => "server_config", :url => "git://github.com/peter/server_config.git"
end

Checkout the plugin and add it to .gitignore:

rake git:plugins:checkout

Check status and update your plugins:

rake git:plugins:status
rake git:plugins:pull
